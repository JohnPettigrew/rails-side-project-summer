# \#SideProjectSummer

This project was intended to produce a basic site that could support the \#SideProjectSummer project by [Emma Barnes](https://twitter.com/has_many_books). It never really saw the light of day, but was mostly about learning Ruby on Rails and it definitely worked on that front!  :-)
